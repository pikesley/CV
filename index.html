<h2>June 2011 - present: DevOps Engineer for <a href="http://www.amee.com">AMEE UK Ltd</a>, London</h2>

<p>AMEE is a start-up whose mission is to measure the carbon footprint of everything on the planet.</p>

<p>Working closely with AMEE's relatively small team of Java and Ruby devs, I've been responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Putting in a huge amount of Chef plumbing (running off of <a href="http://www.amee.com/blog/2012/02/22/building-a-chef-server-from-scratch/">our own Chef server</a>) - AMEE's config management previously consisted of a handful of bash scripts. Any new stuff rolled out since late 2011 has been configuration-managed by Chef, and I expect to have all existing infrastructure in the hands of Chef before the end of 2012</li>
<li>Deploying and configuring Splunk</li>
<li>Migrating several of AMEE's legacy apps from leased iron in a DC to AWS</li>
</ul><p>alongside the usual SysAdmin work of backup-and-restore, capacity planning, etc.</p>

<h2>August 2009 – June 2011: Systems Administrator for <a href="http://www.visualdna.com">Imagini Ltd</a>, London</h2>

<p>Imagini is a dynamic startup based in Soho. The company generates profiles for users through the use of visual quizzes, working with clients including the LA Times, match.com and the Daily Mirror.</p>

<p>My role at Imagini was pretty much DevOps before I knew that DevOps was even a thing – as a busy startup with diverse client projects there were often multiple deploys per day, meaning I had to work very closely with the developers to make sure we were all on the same page.</p>

<p>This close working relationship was particularly fruitful during the gradual transfer of many of Imagini’s core services from the legacy platform (a couple of racks of Linux boxes in a London datacentre) to Amazon Web Services. The back-and-forth between myself and the development team was invaluable as we iterated through various combinations of EC2 Instance Types to find the setup that best fitted our requirements.</p>

<p>The transfer to AWS accelerated rapidly during 2011; the setup I left them with included:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 16-node Cassandra cluster</li>
<li>A 6-node Hadoop cluster</li>
<li>Several groups of Elastic-Load-Balanced web servers</li>
</ul><p>This platform is still in production use, including an all-new Quiz Engine which as far as I know is still performing extremely well.</p>

<p>During my time at Imagini I also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Completely rewrote the legacy deployment system (in Python), and subsequently repurposed a lot of this code to handle AWS deploy</li>
<li>Introduced the MMM multi-master replication manager for MySQL on the front-end database servers</li>
<li>Cleaned-up and reorganised the Subversion repositories (the better to integrate with my new deploy system)</li>
<li>Managed a migration from Akamai EdgeControl to Amazon Cloudfront</li>
<li>Substantially rewrote the ‘event-tracking and processing’ system</li>
<li>Managed a migration from hosted Exchange email to Google Mail</li>
</ul><h2>August 2003 – August 2009: Systems Administrator for <a href="http://www.rexfeatures.com">Rex Features Ltd</a>, London</h2>

<p>Rex Features is Britain’s leading independent photographic press agency and picture library. Rex supplies a daily service of news, celebrity, features, and stock photos to all national newspapers, magazines, TV, web and other media in the UK and in more than 30 countries worldwide.</p>

<p>My work at Rex covered the usual gamut of Sysadmin tasks, including: backup and recovery, webserver administration, DNS management, plenty of scripting (mostly in bash), patching servers, and writing and maintaining documentation. There was also some SQL Server admin, and a certain amount of desktop support – Rex is a company of ~80 employees, supported by an IT department of four. All new server hardware passed through my hands for installation and configuration.</p>

<p>When I joined Rex, the IT department consisted of two very busy people. The IT infrastructure had been growing rapidly, deployment had happened on a seemingly ad-hoc basis, and documentation was fairly sparse. My initial tasks included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing a CVS server (yes, this was 2003) and gathering code and scripts into it</li>
<li>Rolling out the Amanda backup system and setting up a proper backup and recovery scheme</li>
<li>Getting the RT ticketing system up and running (we later moved to Jira)</li>
<li>Beginning the process of documenting everything in Twiki (we subsequently migrated to Mediawiki)</li>
</ul><p>Subsequently, I was directly involved in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up the Nagios network monitoring system</li>
<li>Migrating the internal mail from Novell to Exchange, and later outsourcing this function to Cobweb’s hosted Exchange platform</li>
<li>Configuring VPNs between Rex’s headquarters and various locations – initially using isakmpd on OpenBSD, and latterly on a Watchguard Firebox</li>
<li>Overseeing the transfer of Rex’s image data – 5 terabytes of jpegs at the time of writing – from a cluster based on a number of FreeBSD servers to a set of Network Appliance 3050 filers</li>
<li>Configuring and deploying Alteon load-balancers for the Rex website, which gets ~1.5 million hits and shifts ~13 gigs of data a day</li>
<li>Migrating Rex’s code from CVS to Subversion</li>
<li>Specifying and documenting a “standard Rex server install” – except for a handful of Windows servers, the whole of Rex’s server room and colo are running FreeBSD, so the standard install is a set of common ports and a number of scripts.</li>
</ul><p>Rex went on to acquire another picture agency in Los Angeles, which brought about a project to integrate their image archive into Rex’s, modifying the server software to enable them to use the Rex client application, and deploying a new set of servers to support of all of this. The final setup consisted of a redundant pair of Microsoft SQL servers, a set of NetApp filers and shelves, and a group of FreeBSD servers (running apache and mod_perl) serving up three websites and a range of internal webservices, all sitting behind a pair of Alteon load-balancers.</p>

<h2>April 2000 – July 2003: Systems Administrator for Empower Interactive Ltd, London</h2>

<p>Empower Interactive was a telecoms software startup, founded in 2000 in the City of London. The company grew from an initial team of eight to a team of approximately 60 people based all over the globe.</p>

<p>Having joined Empower at its inception, my initial responsibilities were to design and implement the IT infrastructure necessary to support the operations of the fledgling business. This included: network planning; server acquisition and installation (various internal servers, external mail server, firewall, etc); deploying a backup and recovery scheme; managing the website; and a great deal of user education. I also got involved in many other aspects of the business – this was a tiny start-up, so I found myself doing testing, writing user manuals for Empower’s products, and even doing a little Java.</p>

<p>I was solely responsible for supporting this infrastructure for the first year, until the business expanded to the extent that further IT staff were required. I was asked to set up an IT department, and recruited another Sysadmin who specialised in Windows; the team continued to expand over the following years. I gained experience with Solaris 8, HP-UX and qualified as an Oracle administrator in order to install some of Empower’s products onto carrier-grade hardware; I also assisted with deploying the hardware into telcos.</p>

<p>Empower unfortunately ceased trading in November 2006.</p>
